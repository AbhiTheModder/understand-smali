As I mentioned, I'll be adding the pictures of any queries users ask me, to the next day wiki. So, here it is:

Let's take an app : 
I've taken [Benime Whiteboard Video Maker](https://apkpure.com/benime-whiteboard-video-maker/com.benzveen.doodlify)

You can watch his full video from <a href="https://t.me/ApkEditorPr00/958">here</a>

* When you'll download the app from apkpure, or any website, you'll see it's in an extensions .apks or .zip or .xapk formats. Simply, these are as a archive or bundle format to make size of output less. To convert them, we need to convert it into .apk, format for which we use **Antisplit-G2 or SAI**.


### After converting to apk, now we are about to start our work üòú:

* GO to the location with MT Manager where the converted apk format is. 

Open the apk and click on any classes.dex then select dex editor plus, then select all the dex:

Now from the search option, search for **DoodleMainActivity**.

> Now you'll be thinking similar to those tutorials, I'm going to skip it and will let it up to you to wonder how I came to this conclusion, to search only for **DoodleMainActivity** üòÇ
> 
Well don't worry, I'm not going to do that :D
 * Reasons why **DoodleMainActivity** is being searched:
1. As I mentioned, it's good if you have a little Java knowledge, even only creating the _hello world!_ app in Java, is enough for beginning the reverse engineering... Now, if you recall your memory a little bit, you'll remember that the first file during making of that `hello world!` project, we created a java file named as **MainActivity**, and in that file, we wrote everything and afterwards we built the application. When that application was opened, it showed us _hello world!_ text on Main Screen.
2. Similarly, every app has it's MainActivity, which it opens first on launch of the application, and in this app (i.e. Benime), that activity is **DoodleMainActivity**.
3. It's always recommended to first check the opening actvity of any app during reverse engineering of it for many reasons, such as, checking what is it doing on run, and sometimes devs leave their important stuffs here also, like in-app purchases details, which we guys need üòÅ
4. So, I hope these reasons are enough for you to understand why **DoodleMainActivity** is being searched.

* Open the first result which you get and just like in the below image click on `goto` it'll lead you guy's to the** DoodleMainActivity**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220589905-9766f8d9-7108-4bb4-bdc1-111a5ae79f72.png" width=350>

## First let's know about **static field** in Java:
* I searched on google for its quicker and short understanding and you can see:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220591408-431e1274-c2f0-41d9-b412-d0d6291d77c3.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220590692-f6e81675-2934-40ee-b120-1dc52387ea50.png)

* From these results one thing is clear that it's being used to store some values 
* Now let's see what we get in the **DoodleMainActivity** class:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220592275-442f677f-c3ed-4520-bffd-894fa39d38c9.png)

**aha üòú So there is an static field in this class, that means R:Z is being used to store some value and what does `Z` represents in smali? (ofcourse, boolean). So, it only can store two values i.e., either true or false.**

> **NOTE**: It's to be noted, that every time you see static fields in classes of app, it doesn't mean that it's right, and you start editing with that, and then complain about **not working, but you still followed my method in another app** LoL ü§£. We have to analyze that class, to see if the **in-app purchases are related to that field or not**, only then start editing them.

* Now after analysing the code, we come to the conclusion, that this field is the value where data is stored. You can also see as `ca-pub-xxx` etc. codes are used for Ads and in-app purchases:

* Now, search for the places inside the class, where that static field is called, and we reach here:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220595225-c085947e-bbcb-404d-b0a3-60d8fe7f1679.png)

* For more understanding of below lines, refer to <a href="https://github.com/AbhiTheModder/understand-smali/wiki/DAY-02">DAY 02</a>

> Now let's understand through line 1 of `G(Ljava/lang/Boolean;)V`. We can understand that, first it's creating boolean to register p1 to store bool value in it, then through `if-eqz` checking if value of p1 results 0 (false) or 1 (true) and if the value results in 0 then it'll go to :cond_13 i.e., line 237, where you can see, it'll then make p1 value 0 and use the field bool R:Z which we see earlier here... from above image, we can also see if it's false, it'll skip the result and will not excecute the below codes of if-eqz, so as to run, we'll move these codes inside the condition, as:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85984486/220597715-97fed673-71e8-43b6-91e4-dedc4a63e897.png" wdth=350>

Then, we'll return the value as return-void, because register v0 value is being stored to p1:

* Now let's move on and it's similar ( as there is also same codes just we need to remove the if-eqz code, which I discussed earlier about ) to above process, so I'll be skipping it's explanation. Still if anyone of you don't understand the processes below, then as always, I say you're free to ask to me at <a href="https://telegram.me/Qbtaumai">@Qbtaumai</a> üòâ:
