# Some info to take note of before reading:
# - opcode: The hexadecimal representation of the opcode.
# - name: The name of the opcode.
# - format: The format of the opcode. For more read: https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/instruction-formats
# - format_id: The format id of the opcode.
# - syntax: The Usual syntax of the opcode.
# - args_info: The information about the arguments of the opcode.
# - short_desc: A short description of the opcode.
# - long_desc: A long description of the opcode.
# - note: Any additional notes about the opcode.

# Register informations:
# - vA: It is always a destination register on this document and a single <A> represents a 4-bit register, i.e, first 16 registers (0-15).
# As such vAA represents an 8-bit register, i.e, first 256 registers (0-255), and vAAAA represents a 16-bit register, i.e, first 64k registers (0-65535).
# - vB: It is always a source register on this document and denotion of <B> is same as <A>.
# Arguments which indicate a literal value have the form "#+X".
# Arguments which indicate a relative instruction address offset have the form "+X".
# Arguments which indicate a literal constant pool index have the form "kind@X", where "kind" indicates which constant pool is being referred to.
